#-Scene and character commands
#-----------------------
#Scene command: Insert the backgrounds into the images folder in your files and then you can call them with the 
# bg followed by the file name 

#Show command: Same as the Scene, insert into the images tab and it can be freely called in the code so long as everyone
# has the images uploaded

#WARNING: Files are case sensitive so they should each be given unique names. Reason being that if one word is similar
# it will overwrite any other onscreen asset with similar words in it
